Topic: LVM - Logical Volume Management

LVM is a technique for creating dynamically expandable storage volumes. A mounted volume can be expanded on the fly with no need for restarting services using it.

Logically steps for creating a LVM device are:
- Create a (logical) volume group and add physical devices to it.
- Create a logical partition using the volume group
- Make a file system (like ext4) to the partition and mount it
- Afterwards the logical partition can be expanded to the limit of free space in volume group and volume group by adding physical devices

Steps to create a brand new LVM device:

# lsblk  (diagnose)
# pvcreate /dev/xvdc /dev/xvde         (not needed necessarily)
# vgcreate vg200 /dev/xvdc /dev/xvde   (Create the pool)
# lvcreate -n vision200 -L 2G vg200    (Create a mountable partition)
# mkfs.xfs /dev/vg200/vision200        (Make filesystem)
# mount /dev/vg200/vision200 /vision200
